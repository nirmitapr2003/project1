				<td>Joey Tribbiani</td>
				<td><img src="download(2).jpg"></td>
				<td><a href="https://youtu.be/1FC8D_3BQdE">This is a link</a><br>
					<td>Joey is portrayed as promiscuous and dim-witted but good-natured, as well as very loyal, caring, and protective of his friends. He is a food-loving womanizer who has had more luck with dates than any of the other group members. In contrast to his "ladies man" personality, he has also a marked childish side.</td>

				<td>Chandler Bing</td>

				<td><a href="<a href="https://youtu.be/1FC8D_3BQdE">This is a link</a><br>">This is a link</a><br></td>
				<td>Personality. Though Chandler never lets up by using sarcasm as a defense, he has a tendency to come off as needy and makes bad first impressions as said by Phoebe with his constant joke-making and brash demeanor. Despite this emotional immaturity, Chandler is the most financially secure of his friends.</td>

				<td>Ross Geller</td>
				<td><img src="download(4).jpg"></td>
				<td><a href="<a href="https://youtu.be/AOVTkzaF9kM">This is a link</a><br>"This is a link</a><br></td>
				<td>While he is smart, polite, caring, thoughtful and kind, Ross is often clumsy and socially awkward - taking the characteristics of the stereotypical "loser nerd". He is sometimes shown to have a good sense of humor. He is the only member of the group of friends with a doctorate and, as such, can be arrogant.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Phoebe Buffay</td>
				<td><img src="download(5).jpg"></td>
				<td><a href="<a href="https://youtu.be/esrF2oDUFYU">This is a link</a><br>">This is a link</a><br></td>
				<td>Personality. Phoebe is a sweet-natured but odd guitar player. Having experienced nothing like a normal, complete childhood, Phoebe is often very dim-witted, sometimes smart and is in some regards still a child at heart. She believed Santa Claus existed, until Joey told her otherwise.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Monica Geller</td>
				<td><img src="download(6).jpg"></td>
				<td><a href="<a href="https://youtu.be/NR01VOaDbuw">This is a link</a><br>">This is a link</a><br></td>
				<td>energetic, hyper, and obsessive-compulsive. She's the “mother” of the group, and like some mothers, she can be overbearing and domineering. But she can also be the level-headed practical friend, helping others through their irrational moments. Monica is loyal and caring.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Rachel Green</td>
				<td><img src="download(7).jpg"></td>
				<td><a href="<a href="https://youtu.be/m6xWpf1zemI">This is a link</a><br>">This is a link</a><br></td>
				<td>According to Rachel's original character description, written by Crane and Kauffman themselves for the show's pilot, the character is a spoiled yet courageous young woman who "has worked for none of what she has", unlike best friend Monica, and is initially "equipped to do nothing".</td>
